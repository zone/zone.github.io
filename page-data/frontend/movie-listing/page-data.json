Provide instructions on how to run the project and any notes about your solution.</li>\n<li>ü§© Feel free to use a JavaScript framework. We use React, Vue and plain JavaScript here but use what you‚Äôre most comfortable with.</li>\n<li>ü§® You can also use a starter kit like <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#readme\">Create React App</a> or <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html#CLI\">Vue CLI</a> to save time.</li>\n<li>ü§ó We love clean, responsive interfaces. Pick your favourite <a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/\">Google font</a> and layout the movies in a grid, adjusting the number of columns as the device width allows.</li>\n<li>üßê We‚Äôre most interested to see problem solving and your approach‚Ä¶ also ES6 please.</li>\n<li>üòá Keep it simple, keep it DRY, but don‚Äôt over complicate or over engineer, comment and test as much as possible.</li>\n<li>ü§ì Commit your code to a public Git repository and provide us with the URL.</li>\n<li>üòé We know your time is precious. If you aren‚Äôt able to complete all tasks, or if you use third party styles or components to speed things up - no worries! Just detail what you‚Äôve prioritised and why in your README.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Brief</h2>\n<p>Using the TMDb API display a list of now showing movies allowing the user to filter by genre and rating. Don't worry about pagination, the first page is fine.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: <a href=\"https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup\">You‚Äôll need an TMDb account</a> to request an API key. Once you are registered, go to account settings and click 'API' in sidebar.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Input</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-now-playing\">TMDb Movies Now Playing API</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/genres/get-movie-list\">TMDb Movie genres API</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/images\">TMDb Image API</a></li>\n<li>Minimum rating input with a range between 0 and 10, increments of 0.5 and a default set to 3.</li>\n<li>Multiple genres input (checkboxes).

For example if 'Action' and 'Drama' genres are selected listed movies must have <strong>both</strong> 'Action' and 'Drama' genres.</li>\n<li>Movies should also be filterable by their rating (<code>vote_average</code> property). i.e If rating was set to 5, you would expect to see all movies with a rating of 5 or higher.</li>\n<li>The input API's should only be called once.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"description":"Display a list of movies allowing the user to filter by genre and rating.","subTitle":"Frontend","title":"Movie listings challenge"}}},"pageContext":{"description":"Display a list of movies allowing the user to filter by genre and rating.","subTitle":"Frontend","title":"Movie listings challenge","slug":"/frontend/movie-listing","subPageRegex":"/^/frontend/movie-listing//"}}}
