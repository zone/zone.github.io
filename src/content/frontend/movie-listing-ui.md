> This is not a test! Seriously, try and have fun with it, make it your own!

## Introduction

- 😍 Be sure to write comments, a README and any assumptions. Provide instructions on how to run the project and any notes about your solution.
- 🤩 Feel free to use a JavaScript framework. We use React, Vue and plain JavaScript here but use what you’re most comfortable with.
- 🤨 You can also use a starter kit like [Create React App][create-react-app] or [Vue CLI][vue-cli] to save time.
- 🤗 We love clean, responsive interfaces. Pick your favourite [Google font][google-fonts] and layout the movies in a grid, adjusting the number of columns as the device width allows.
- 🧐 We’re most interested in how you return and layout the results. Also, please don't use a CSS framework.
- 😇 Keep it simple, keep it DRY, but don’t over complicate or over engineer, comment and test as much as possible.
- 🤓 Commit your code to a public Git repository and provide us with the URL.
- 😎 We know your time is precious. If you aren’t able to complete all tasks, or if you use third party styles or components to speed things up - no worries! Just detail what you’ve prioritised and why in your README.

## Brief

Using the TMDb API display a list of now showing movies allowing the user to filter by rating. Don't worry about pagination, the first page is fine.

> Note: [You’ll need an TMDb account][tmdb-signup] to request an API key. Once you are registered, go to account settings and click 'API' in sidebar.

## Input

- [TMDb Movies Now Playing API][tmdb-now-playing]
- [TMDb Image API][tmdb-images]
- Minimum rating input with a range between 0 and 10, increments of 0.5 and a default set to 3.

## Output

- Display a list of movies, each showing their title, genres and poster image.
- The movies should be ordered by popularity (most popular first - `popularity` property).
- Movies should also be filterable by their rating (`vote_average` property). i.e If rating was set to 5, you would expect to see all movies with a rating of 5 or higher.
- The input API's should only be called once.
